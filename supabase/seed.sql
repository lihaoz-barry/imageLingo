-- Seed file for ImageLingo
-- This file is run after migrations during `supabase db reset`
-- Add sample data here for local development and preview branches

-- Example: Insert sample data (uncomment and modify as needed)
-- INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, created_at) VALUES
--   ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'demo@example.com', now());

-- Note: Preview branches are seeded with this data automatically
-- Production data is NOT copied to preview branches for security
