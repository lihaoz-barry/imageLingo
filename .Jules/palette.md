## 2025-05-24 - Dark Mode Focus Visibility
**Learning:** Standard browser focus rings (often blue) lack sufficient contrast against the application's deep purple/black gradient backgrounds, making keyboard navigation difficult.
**Action:** Standardize on `outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white/50 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-black/20` for high-contrast visibility on all primary actions.
